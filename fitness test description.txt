This test consists of four exercises, each scored on a 0-100 scale with no failures. The system is based on military standards but adapted to always provide a score, even at lower performance levels.

📌 Test Structure:
1. Pull-Ups – Measures upper body strength
2. Push-Ups (2 min max reps) – Tests muscular endurance
3. Plank Hold – Assesses core endurance
4. 2-Mile Run (3.2 km) – Evaluates cardiovascular fitness

Your final score is the average of all four events.

📌 Scoring System (0-100 per event)

1️⃣ Pull-Ups (5 Points Per Rep)
Formula:
  Score = min(5 × pull-ups, 100)
Example:
  - 10 pull-ups → 50 points
  - 17 pull-ups → 85 points
  - 21 pull-ups → 100 points (capped)

2️⃣ Push-Ups (Linear Scale, Rounded Down to 0.5)
Formula:
  Score = min((push-ups × 100) / 80, 100)
  - Round down to the nearest 0.5.
Example:
  - 40 push-ups → (40 × 100) / 80 = 50 → 50 points
  - 67 push-ups → (67 × 100) / 80 = 83.75 → 83.5 points
  - 82 push-ups → 100 points (capped)

3️⃣ Plank Hold (Exponential Scale)
Formula:
  Score = 100 × (1 - e^(-1.2 × (time in minutes)))
Example:
  - 1:00 min → 10.9 points
  - 2:00 min → 26.9 points
  - 3:00 min → 50.7 points
  - 4:00 min → 72.6 points
  - 5:00 min → 86.5 points
  - 6:00 min → 94.2 points
  - 7:00+ min → 100 points

4️⃣ 2-Mile Run (Formula for Every Second)
Formula:
  Score = max(100 - 5 × ((time in seconds - 720) / 30), 0)
Example:
  - 12:00 min (720s) → 100 points
  - 13:00 min (780s) → 90 points
  - 14:00 min (840s) → 80 points
  - 16:00 min (960s) → 60 points
  - 18:00 min (1080s) → 40 points
  - 20:00 min (1200s) → 20 points
  - 22:00 min (1320s) → 0 points

📌 Summary of Formulas
| Event | Formula |
|----------|------------|
| Pull-Ups | Score = min(5 × pull-ups, 100) |
| Push-Ups | Score = min((push-ups × 100) / 80, 100) (rounded down to 0.5) |
| Plank Hold | Score = 100 × (1 - e^(-1.2 × (time in minutes))) |
| 2-Mile Run | Score = max(100 - 5 × ((time in seconds - 720) / 30), 0) |

📌 Final Score Calculation:
Total Score = (Pull-Up Score + Push-Up Score + Plank Score + Run Score) / 4

📌 Fitness Level Classification:
| Final Score | Level |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 90-100  | Elite (Special Forces Ready) |
| 80-89   | Excellent |
| 70-79   | Good |
| 60-69   | Average |
| 40-59   | Below Average |
| 20-39   | Needs Improvement |
| 0-19    | Beginner |

📌 Example Calculation:
- Pull-Ups: 15 → 75 points
- Push-Ups: 55 → 68.5 points
- Plank Hold: 3:30 min → 61.2 points
- 2-Mile Run: 14:40 min → 75 points

Final Score:
(75 + 68.5 + 61.2 + 75) / 4 = 69.9
Rating: "Average"
